In 2001, the castle became the focus of one of the largest paranormal investigations in history, with participants reporting shadowy figures, temperature drops, and ghostly encounters.

Furthermore, Whaley and his wife are believed to inhabit the house, leaving traces of their presence with wafts of cigar smoke and perfume.
